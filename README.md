# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. It shows what I have programmed the website to look like on different scales. So, instead of the website crashing when someone looking at it on an iphone it just looks different but still functionable due to the programming. This was my main concern so anyone on any type of scrren can look at our website with full functionability.

**Figma**

figma was used for me to look at so I knew what the website needed to look like to begin with and then I was able to lean off figma for the different screen sizes and some of the other things that I needed to do was off of my imagination.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
